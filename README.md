# Recipe Blog

An Umbraco 11 site for storing great recipes. 

## Setup

Setup should be relatively simple. Document types and some initial content are serialised using uSync so run an import after logging into Umbraco to quickly get a workable project.
The database connection string is in hidden in User Secrets.

## TODO

- Styling
- Server-side rendering of React
- Exclude specific nodes from uSync
- Measurement conversion
- 'Do not sleep' mode for mobile to prevent the screen from turning off
